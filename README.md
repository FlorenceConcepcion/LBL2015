# LBL2015
Work at LBL in July 2015

##Tasks
1. Check sample of Ias is correct
	
	- Is there a better way of doing this?

2. Get the photometric sample. i.e. Those non-spec confirmed, where is this table?

	- If there is a host assocoiated with these then look up in  NED/SDSS for the host redshift

3. Find objects we have missed.
